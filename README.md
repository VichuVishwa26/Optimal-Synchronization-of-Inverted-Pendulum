# Optimal-Synchronization-of-Inverted-Pendulum
A chaotic or unstable inverted pendulum is made to stabilize by using LQR and PID controllers.

Inverted pendulum is a system in which the center of the mass is above the pivot point, where the mass can freely rotate. The inverted pendulum, a highly nonlinear unstable system, is used as a benchmark for implementing the control methods. This research mainly focusses on balancing an inverted pendulum with reaction wheel. The study objective is to control the system such that the cart reaches a desired position and the inverted pendulum stabilizes in the upright position. In this paper, the modelling and simulation for optimal control design of nonlinear inverted pendulum-cart dynamic system using PID controller and LQR have been presented. The finding in this research is that torque is generated by the acceleration of the reaction wheel. Higher acceleration gives a high torque. Others findings is the PID parameter; Proportional gain increases the response rate, Integral gain is used to eliminate steady state error; Derivative gain is used to lessen the overshoot. The simulation results justify the comparative advantage of LQR over PID control method.
